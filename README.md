RESTful Web Service with Spring boot

This is a RESTful Web Service (WS) project with spring boot. I applied the concepts I have learned about RESTful WS to build a simple 
project to manage all the books I have in my library.

I have implemented Spring data jpa, HATEOUS, actuator, Swagger, AOP, security to name a few.
